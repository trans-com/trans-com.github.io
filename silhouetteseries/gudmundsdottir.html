        - "With a palm full of
        stars I throw them like dice on the table until the desired constellation
        appears" ... sings Björk on the Medulla album. If you were seeking a metaphor
        for her extraordinary approach to music making, that lyric would serve nicely. Clearly a woman
        to be reckoned with, she has enough creative passion, drive for experimentation,
        originality and the avante garde in her DNA to put the vast majority to shame. In Sugarcubes
        mode, Bjork was a partner in the delivery of a truly alternative sound, often challenging the
        listener with her voice-as-instrument and lyrical content. Her solo career
        illustrates a constantly innovative and creative body of art that has been of great influence
        to so many in the field of (not only) electronic music. What is it about Iceland
        that creates such wonders?&nbsp;<br>

                        <b>DHARMA BUFFER</b> is the performance project creation of
                        <b> James Clark</b>, who has been a&nbsp;key player in the Brisbane electronic music scene since the&nbsp;formative years of the early 90s. James was one of the
                        original
                        collaborators with Trans:Com, initially as a founding member of the
                        brilliant Blood Party, and later through his studio production,
                        remixing and live engineering work. James, who is incidentally a&nbsp;collector of vintage drum
                        machines, has collaborated with most
                        of Brisbane’s electronic&nbsp;pioneers, including <b>Dogmachine</b>, <b>Ostia</b>, <b>Sphere</b>,
                        <b> The Isle</b>, and more recently <b>Zephyr Timbre</b> and
                        <b> My Ninja Lover</b> - and is considered (by Trans:Com at least) to be the
                        ‘Martin Hannett’ of Brisbane. The story of his production of the
                        ‘Cyberia’ CD compilation&nbsp;is almost legendary.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>
                        Dharma Buffer debuted on the critically acclaimed ‘Abstraction’&nbsp;<br>
                        compilation with two breath taking works and has performed live on
                        only a few (brilliant) occasions featuring&nbsp;co-conspirators <b> Nicky Perry</b> 
                        (drums &amp; percussion)
                        and <b> Mirko Vogel</b> of <b>Sekiden </b>fame.&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>
                        James Clark has produced, mastered and engineered for a
                        number of Brisbane's leading bands both past and presetn.

                        <b>LAWRENCE ENGLISH</b> is a writer, musician and media
                        artist based in Brisbane. Working across a broad range
                        of art forms, English's work is eclectic and
                        characterises a long-term exploration of various themes
                        - including audio / visual environments seen in his recent
                        installation work Ghost Towns.<br>
                        <br>
                        For over a decade, English's audio explorations have
                        sprawled across a range of areas. Sonically, the work
                        calls into question the established relationships
                        between approaches to sound and structure - traversing
                        experimental soundscapes and free improvisation to
                        processed beat works and concréte- influenced
                        compositions, his back catalogue spans a dynamic array
                        of frameworks. London's 'Time Out' referred to his
                        output as 'ambient twisted soundscapes and challenging
                        sonic scree', and US sound journal, 'Signal to Noise',
                        described English's work as 'extraordinarily gorgeous
                        modern music concréte'.<br>
                        <br>
                        In recent years English has performed and improvised
                        with the likes of David Toop, Ami Yoshida, Oren Ambarchi,
                        Marina Rosenfeld, DJ Olive, Philip Samartzis, Toshio
                        Kajiwara, Scanner, Tetuzi Akiyama, Janek Schaefer and KK
                        Null. English has been producing a number of full-
                        length
                        recordings for a variety of artists including Japan's
                        avant- pop icon Tujiko Noriko and Australian noise-pop
                        unit The Rational Academy. He has also recently composed
                        new works for guitar for the renowned new music ensemble
                        Elision.<br>

                        Outside of his recordings and art commissions, Lawrence
                        English curates a number of on-going sound events

                        Smith. With music best described as a mix of electronic
                        beats and darkwave stylings their influences are as
                        diverse as Aphex Twin, Kate Bush, Portishead, Tori Amos,

                        (a plant from the aralia family) DIZZYGOTHECA's heavy
                        atmospheric sound is attributed to Anthony's beats and
                        Heidi's siren like vocals, tracks like &quot;Cut&quot;
                        have been compared to Sigur and Björk. Their live sets
                        feature melodies and triggered beats in realtime rather
                        than totally sequenced.<br>
                        <br>
                        Their subject matter for songs stem from their own
                        dealing's with the human experience, messy breakups,
                        feelings of isolation or just plain old anger with no
                        holding back on delicate subjects.<br>
                        <br>
                        Anthony started playing music in 2002 when he moved to
                        Brisbane from Melbourne with his own solo electro act
                        called 'Hazyinseptember'. Heidi played in a couple of
                        underground rock and folk bands (guitar &amp; vox) in
                        Georgia (USA) before moving back to Brisbane in late
                        2004. Together they evolved with a shared love of doing
                        strange things to music.<br>

                        SIMON ROOTS</b> was born in Britain, and emigrated to
                        Australia at an early age. Working initially in
                        illustration and cartooning he then made the move to
                        fine arts. Completing a Diploma of Visual Arts
                        (Painting) in 2003, he is currently pursuing a Bachelor
                        of Fine Arts at the <b>Queensland College of Art</b>.
                        His interest lies primarily in painting, printmaking and
                        assemblage. He won a Scholarship Grant in 2004 and
                        studied for the Fall (Autumn) Semester in Philadelphia,
                        USA, at the <b>Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts</b>.
                        A regular exhibitor he was selected for the 2003 and
                        2005 Churchie Emerging Art Exhibition. His work is
                        represented in a number of private collections. A keen
                        collaborator he has curated a number of exhibitions and
                        assisted with the Visual Arts section of the <b>Wataboshi
                        Festival</b>.&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>
                        Simon's interest is in the influence of mass media and
                        its affects on human behaviour. His painting is a way to
                        reinterpret a world filled with the instant visual
                        imagery of photography, popular media and the internet.
                        It's an island for the considered contemplation of
                        ideas, the slow absorption of layers of meaning, as
                        contrasted with the instant fix and didactic nature of
                        mass media.&nbsp;<br>

                        ARTIST STATEMENT:<br>
                        &quot;What makes people tick? Contemporary society is
                        full of contradiction and mystery, and can invoke the
                        most fascinating human behaviour. What are the
                        motivations and obsessions that drive us all? As an
                        artist, I’m interested in the themes that help us
                        construct our version of reality and how easily those
                        ideas can be subverted or misunderstood.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
