                        <b>TYCHO BRAHE</b> is based in&nbsp;Brisbane, Australia,
                        producing original electronic pop music in&nbsp;the vein of New
                        Order, Depeche Mode, Human League and Giorgio Moroder, etc. The band takes its name
                        from a pivotal but flawed 16th century self taught Danish
                        astronomer, as testimony to the band's
                        self taught "do it yourself" ethic.The band was founded by
                        KEN EVANS (vocals, programming, guitar) in 1993.
                        GEORGINA EMERY (vocals, keyboards) began taking a visible role in the
                        band from 1995 onwards, having been involved prior to that as a&nbsp;behind the scenes co-writer.
                        Revolving around these two core
                        members, the band has a&nbsp;long and stable history, both
                        as a self actuated recording project, and as a live act.&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>
	Over the years Tycho Brahe has become an established,&nbsp;confident and professional live band, touring
                        within Australia&nbsp;and sharing the stage with other prominent acts
                        such as Real Life,
                        VNV Nation, and Pseudo Echo. Live performances have become an
                        important
                        aspect of the band, not only to maintain the interest of the local
                        fanbase, but as a means to refining new songs&nbsp;for eventual recording.&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>
                        FRANCIS TOHILL,&nbsp;Tycho’s precision drummer, uses a full
                        electronic drumkit to&nbsp;recreate the machine sounds of Tycho
                        Brahe's electronic beats onstage. This almost traditional, but electronic, rhythm
                        section of the band gives the live act a certain energy, and
                        allows a degree of flexibility in live performances not seen
                        with many typical electronic acts.
	Tycho Brahe's new album "Atlantic" is due for release in&nbsp;February 2006 through US&nbsp;label Cohaagen Music.
                        Previous releases include the albums
                        "Cassiopeia" (‘00) and&nbsp;"Tasty" (‘01), and the singles "Avarice" (‘02) &amp; "Don't
                        Feel That Way"
                        (‘05).<br>

                        This year the 'Loaf also racked up a warm-up set for Boston post-metal act Isis, who
                        reportedly knighted the band as favourite support of the tour. Time Off
                        Magazine described PONYLOAF's appearance at the Isis show as, "...like a

                        <b>ANNA PETROU</b> - At 19 she staged her first solo
                        exhibition entitled &quot;Expressions&quot; at the
                        School of Arts Building, Bundaberg. At this time her
                        work comprised experiments in oil, acrylic and
                        assemblage on canvas depicting the male and female form.
                        To this day she still pursues her interest in capturing
                        the emotional subtlety of the human form and aims to reproduce the intimate moments
                        and depth and honesty of
                        the human spirit through her drawing, painting and
                        sculpture.&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>
                        Her interest in mixed media sculpture lead her to
                        experiment and produce wearable sculpture in the form of
                        dramatic costume jewelry pieces. Later she would use flexible
                        plastics, and porcelain-like clay material.<br>
                        <br>
                        Prior to graduating from QUT with a degree in Business,
                        a stint in Bundaberg resulted in her drawing and
                        painting taking on a more abstract 2D
                        illustration-style. And the production of a 3x2m acrylic
                        painting on canvas featuring a mother and child in embrace - resembling the Virgin Mary and child - led to
                        its donation to Bundaberg’s Holy Rosary Catholic
                        Church where it was converted into a banner.&nbsp;<br>

                        Anna now lives in Brisbane and from the late 90s onwards
                        she has continued to embrace all mediums, particularly
                        incorporating technology using hybrid-media resources. Working
                        as a graphic designer for <a href="http://www.trans.com.au"> Trans:Com</a> led her to
                        expand
                        creatively into the realms of photography. Most of this work has
                        appeared on the covers of CDs, photography for band
                        promos, posters, and various websites. She continues to work with
                        the label and its collaborators as a side project to this day.<br>
                        <br>
                        2006 will see a collaborative exhibition in an
                        interesting new space, the Brisbane Powerhouse with the
