BOXCAR quote:

October 2007


Not so much a case of a horse that required yet further flogging as that of possibly one too many beers and the reckless cajoling of Tom Ellard :
Boxcar will perform live in Brisbane on October the 28th at the Queensland University of Technology. This will be our first live gig in about 10 years.
Yes, that's a long time to be off the radar, we joined the rats in the race and watched the DJ and laptop boom from other corners of the music
business. The good news is that we have learnt an awful lot in that time - we will be performing new tunes which we hope to release next year
(hell, even if it's free!) and completely rebooted (ie blowtorched into the millenium) old tunes from the back catalog.


Original members, Dave Smith and Stewart Lawler will be joined by Alison Cole (Keys) and Gerrie Mallia (Vox).

In the meantime, suck on this. It's an excerpt from 'Llamatron' - named in honour of an Atari ST game we used to enjoy.
Please nobody say 'old skool' or we'll have to throttle you.

Regards

Boxcar
