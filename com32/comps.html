  A brilliant electronic compilation, and a fine introduction to the new   
  Northern electronic scene. Some of the acts, such as Glitch, Ostia, and Dogmachine 
  are well known, and present their latest work. Others, such as First World, Dharma 
  Buffer, and VISI, are projects related to other acts (in these cases SonnenSystem, 
  Blood Party, and Pure Bunk respectively). The remaining are totally new and we are 
  proud to represent their excellent debuts, including Tycho Brahe, Jandy Rainbow, 
  Inertia (from Perth), The All-Electric Kitchen (from Adelaide), and Velleity.

<TD WIDTH="44%" VALIGN="TOP"><small>
  Soundhive's debut release is a showcase of Australian electronic talent.
The 2 CD set features 25 tracks from 17 artists from Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and surrounding areas. All tracks on the double CD were performed at the 98/99 Dragonflight New Year Festival at Dayboro, South East Queensland.

The First CD, "Body Journey" takes you through a high pace tour of the dance styles played at the last Dragonflight. The diversity of sounds reflects the various backgrounds of the artists from outdoor doofing artists to inner city club groovers.
CD 2, "Mind Trip" travels trough the blissful and bizarre sounds of the more eclectic Dragonflight artists. The theme travels from electronic sound-scapes through the exotic east with some lounge room kitsch thrown in.

	Grime, Eyespine, Shannon O'Neil, and many others. Degrees of deconstruction,

	Dislocations. With output like this, Australia is fast becoming the leading edge
	for global electronic music evolution.

<TD WIDTH="44%" VALIGN="TOP"><small>
  A continual pulse check for local electronic music, Opus Collective 
  takes the genre from pure pop to pure massacre, generally within the 
  space of only a few songs. Yes, the guitar has subverted much of this 
  second collection of anti-pub rock bands! This, their second compilation, 
  presents the work of sixteen artists, with an emphasis on the art of the 
  pop song. Nearly all tracks feature a lead vocal, and the attention to 
  melody is reminiscent of early electronic pop and groups like Depeche Mode, 
  New Order, A Flock Of Seagulls, etc., while the studio aesthetics firmly 
  place this compilation in 1996.

  electronic music from 14 different Clan Analogue acts in Sydney, 
  Wollongong, Canberra and Brisbane. Musically it ventures from the 
  deepest trance-ambient and acid, via maximal impact "doof-factor 9", 
  to experimental dub, electronic analogue art and live techno improvisation. 
  A masterpiece for any situation - dance floor, home listening, chillout, 
  late night experimental radio and even prime-time broadcasting!

  While this cd does not by any means present itself as an ambient

  are confronting in a most surreal but pleasant manner. Each work has 
  its own inconsistent and eclectic moments that further enhance the 
  intrigue that one finds within the world of sound. Aphelion One operates 
  at the boundaries of style in experimental electronic music, ranging 
  from rhythmic, disjointed works, to soundscapes and atmospheres, 
  placing it in one of the most exciting and progressive areas in sound 
  /music /noise making today.
