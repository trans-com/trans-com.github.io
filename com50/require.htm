<h3>Distribution Requirements</h3>
<P>The main requirement for DMD is to give permission to <B>Republic Of Music</B> to
be the exclusive digital distributor of the work/s to the nominated online
store/s and associated territories.</P>
<P>
Note that the distribution agreement must be exclusive to prevent multiple
registrations of the same works with the same online store/s, which is not
permitted.</P>
<P>
Permission can only be given by the copyright owner/controller of the sound
recordings. Note that no copyright is assigned - all music remains (c) and
(p) the copyright owner/controller.</P>
<P>
Based on permitted content (digital sound recording/s, applicable artwork,
associated metadata) supplied to us, we will prepare and deliver the
work/s to the online store's according to their specification. The online
store/s will then facilitate the works for public sale, and periodically make
sales payments and reports to us.</P>
<P>
<B>Republic Of Music</B> is paid a wholesale price for sales of the works by the
online store, and periodically pays the artist / band / third party
cumulative sales royalties based on this wholesale price (according to the
terms of their agreement with us). For example, an artist under a typical
arrangement will receive sales royalties based on 96% of the wholesale
price, with <B>Republic Of Music</B> retaining 4% to cover its payments and
reporting costs.</P>
<P>
Some additional up front costs may apply to a given release. For example it
may be necessary to acquire a mandatory EAN/UCC barcode and prepare
ISRC codes for the work/s prior to distribution.</P>
<P>
<B>Republic Of Music</B> recommends that artists become writer members of both
APRA and AMCOS to ensure that they receive their performance,
mechanical and communication royalty entitlements. Refer to
<a href="http://www.apra.com.au" target="new">APRA/AMCOS</a> for more detail. We also offer publishing services by
invitation through our <a href="http://www.trans.com.au" target="new">Trans:Com</a> label operation.</P>
