<h3>About Us</h3>
<P><B>Republic Of Music</B> represents independent music in all its forms. We
provide the means for unsigned bands, artists, cottage labels and
studios to have their music and video works distributed and selfmanaged
through major online digital media retailers including iTunes
and Bigpond Music.</P>
<P><B>Republic Of Music</B> is run by the founders of the venerable <a href="http://www.trans.com.au" target="new">Transmission
Communications (Trans:Com)</a> - a label formed in 1994 to activate and
support completely new sectors of music production and performance
in Brisbane. We have always supported the ideology and ethics of
independence, art and alternative media.</B>
