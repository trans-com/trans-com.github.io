<h3>Our Services</h3>

<P>Most of the established and trusted Digital Media Retailers, such as iTunes, will
not release works directly from bands and artists, or indeed 'Net-only
operations. They will only work with established labels under strict
distribution agreements, to ensure that many of the previously mentioned
issues are managed as effectively as possible.<P>
<P><B>Republic Of Music</B>, through Trans:Com's established history and online
presence dating back to its inception, is well placed as a partner of iTunes,
Bigpond and others to support Digital Media Distribution (DMD) of
independent music. Put simply, we can facilitate access to trusted online
media stores.</P>
<P>On a standard <a onclick="replaceBody('fees.htm');">fee-for-service basis</a>, Republic Of Music acts as a conduit for
bands, artists, studios, labels, etc that would like to have their rightful
works digitally distributed. As such, our core services are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Digital release and distribution
<LI>Sales management
<LI>Payments
<LI>Reporting
</UL>
<P>... and the artist retains income from sales, less a small % to cover
processing charges.</P>
<P><B>Republic Of Music</B> can also provide additional services beyond the act of
facilitation and tracking, such as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Recording and production
<LI>Advertising, media management and public relations
<LI>Promotional support, such as DJ vinyl or radio CDs
<LI>Design and image development
<LI>Events and performance support
<LI>Rights and records management
</UL>

<P><B>Republic Of Music</B> has invested time, money and effort in setting up the necessary
services, agreements, and means of access to make releasing
independent music online a reasonable and viable option for any independent artist, cottage label or
studio.</P>
<P>Our services represent the most trusted way for independent bands and artists
to reach a huge market - through <u>reliable online stores</u>, <U>proper reporting</u>, <u>control of your own works</u>, and without the
many costs associated with physical product.</P>

<h3>The Online Music Market</h3>
<P>This market has matured to the point where online sales of digital audio
significantly outnumber physical product. Furthermore, consumer audio
technology fully embraces the online world. Almost everyone has an
iPod, MP3 player or mobile phone playing downloaded music. For the
independent musician/label - there has never been a better
opportunity to reach beyond their local domain.</P>
<P>From our point of view there are three sets of issues that are key to the
success of digital distribution; 1) copyright and piracy, 2) artistic
control, and 3) quality vs. quantity. The huge proliferation of
uncontrolled music sharing, temporary MP3 'retailers', together with
the sheer 'noise' on the Net, makes it very hard for an artist to
maintain control of their works whilst making it as widely available as
possible.</P>
<P>Our role is that of filter and facilitator, and our philosophy is to partner with
selected and trusted retailers, and not take a 'scattergun approach' - 
which in an online context is irrelevent. You wouldn't trust your CDs to
a car boot operator at your local markets, so why trust a short-lived
MP3 site?</P>
