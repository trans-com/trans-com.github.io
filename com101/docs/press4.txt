“101” – Less than One Week to Go 
 
We're almost there - less than one week to go…

This Saturday night June 30 at the Brisbane Powerhouse, Transmission Communications (Trans:Com) – Brisbane’s fiercely independent electronic music label - is showcasing Brisbane's finest electronica artists - Low Key + Nude (Michael Hogg, Low Key Operations and Clare McGrogan, Nude Productions), Megaphonik (Simon Beacon, ex Glitch), Hammerhead (Andy Bagley, ex Pure Bunk), and Alieonix (Duncan Fairbrother, ex Sphere and featuring Manta Ray of Zephyr Timbre). 

"101" is an all-too-rare event, focussing 100% on live performance of electronic music, and in the space of the Brisbane Powerhouse it will be even more special. 

ABC Radio National are supporting us through Tim Ritchie's influential Sound Quality show. The night will be webcast live through ABC Online at http://www.abc.net.au/rn/ - just look for the TransCom link. Also keep a watch on the event website at http://www.trans.com.au where the latest details appear including links to the webcast. 

The doors open at 8pm, first act on at 9:30pm. The acts will be preceded by a performance piece called 'Illumination Suite’, which integrates a fine selection of ambient music with an interactive lighting presentation. A good chance to move around, check out the Powerhouse, have a few drinks before immersing yourself in some very very fine electronica. 

If you don't have your tickets yet, or are planning to buy on the night, that's perfectly OK but consider buying in advance from Rocking Horse, the Brisbane Powerhouse Box Office, or online at http://www.trans.com.au as you will also score a product of choice from the available Trans:Com catalogue. That's only $15 (or $13 for concession) for the event PLUS a CD, 12" or tape. 

Anyway - its building up, the sounds will be awesome, the space is exceptional, and there's fun to be had. We'll see you this Saturday, June 30 at the Brisbane Powerhouse from 8pm.
