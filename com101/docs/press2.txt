101 - An Electronica Showcase 

Transmission Communications (Trans:Com) Brisbane's own fiercely independent electronic music label is presenting “101”, an electronic music and cultural showcase on Saturday 30th June at the Brisbane Powerhouse. 

“101” with its dramatic audio and visual offerings promises to re-acquaint Brisbane’s electronic music fans with the real sensation of LIVE electronic music performance. 

Electronic music aficionados can expect to be served courses of fine electronica by four of the best live electronic artists in a premier venue that breathes innovation. 

“101” also officially launches Trans:Com’s Archive Series of Australian electronic music productions and is part of Trans:Com’s plan to re-establish Brisbane’s dominance in the Australian electronica scene. The night will feature:

LOWKEY + NUDE: The collaboration between Michael Hogg (composer, programmer and producer of electronic music) and Clare McGrogan (writer, spoken word artist, composer and co-producer of electronic music). LOW KEY + NUDE have performed live in Berlin and more recently at this year’s Big Day Out (Sydney). LOWKEY+NUDE are shifting from the darker moods previously created and are getting a little bit funky!  The aim for “101” is to maintain their minimalist approach yet explore and develop themselves within the rhythmic disco and electro zones. 

MEGAPHONIK: Born out of the ashes of GLITCH, Simon Beacon’s highly regarded industrial/darkwave studio project, MEGAPHONIK will emerge at “101” to present his unique moody trip-hop style. MEGAPHONIK are back in the studio putting the finishing touches on a debut album. 

HAMMERHEAD: Andy Bagley has had an unhealthy obsession with sound synthesis since an early age. This has manifested itself in a frightening arsenal of electronic equipment. Foolhardy adventurers have capitalised on the talents of a man who wrote the music for former industrial Bris-band PURE BUNK, for post-production work, and remixes for numerous national and international artists. Andy advises that at “101” HAMMERHEAD will be presenting a soothing mix of Greek oompah and grass roots country and western (!).

ALIEONIX: With The Force commanding him to purchase a synthesizer at an early age, Duncan Fairbrother set about deconstructing what he heard into sounds and textures later to find a home in SPHERE; an original of the species that existed through the Nineties. In 2001 we find Duncan capitalising on his exposure to the best of British trance & electronica in the development of ALIEONIX. His appearance at “101” will incorporate a guest vocal appearance from Manta Ray of ZEPHYR TIMBRE. 

The night will open with a performance piece called “Illumination Suite”, a retrospective celebrating some of the best electronica moments in music and video.
