ABC Radio National to Webcast "101" 


ABC Radio National and ABC Online have joined forces with Transmission Communications (Trans:Com) to showcase Brisbane's finest exponents of live electronic music. On Saturday 30th June 2001, the "101" event will be an exceptional live presentation of Brisbane electronic music artists in a venue that breathes innovation - the Brisbane Powerhouse. 

Live electronica performances on the night, from Low Key + Nude, Megaphonik, Hammerhead, and Alieonix, will be simulcast live on the Internet by the ABC, along with an interactive chat room in which "101" artists, organisers and supporters will participate.

This is a fantastic show of support by the national broadcaster to the independent Brisbane electronic music movement. For 25 years, Tim Ritchie - Presentation & Production Director at ABC Radio National, a Triple-J originator, and the man behind the critically acclaimed Radio National show Sound Quality - has been seeking out music that is "interesting, evolutionary, inaccessible and wonderful". Tim, in collaborating with Trans:Com on "101", is "looking forward to making this project a virtual reality via the ABC."

"101" is part of Trans:Com's plan to re-establish Brisbane's dominance in the Australian electronica scene. The night will feature:

LOWKEY + NUDE: The collaboration between Michael Hogg (composer, programmer and producer of electronic music) and Clare McGrogan (writer, spoken word artist, composer and co-producer of electronic music). LOW KEY + NUDE have performed live in Berlin and more recently at this year's Big Day Out (Sydney). LOWKEY+NUDE are shifting from the darker moods previously created and are getting a little bit funky!  The aim for "101" is to maintain their minimalist approach yet explore and develop themselves within the rhythmic disco and electro zones. 

MEGAPHONIK: Born out of the ashes of GLITCH, Simon Beacon's highly regarded industrial/darkwave studio project, MEGAPHONIK will emerge at "101" to present his unique moody trip-hop style. MEGAPHONIK are back in the studio putting the finishing touches on a debut album. 

HAMMERHEAD: Andy Bagley has had an unhealthy obsession with sound synthesis since an early age. This has manifested itself in a frightening arsenal of electronic equipment. Foolhardy adventurers have capitalised on the talents of a man who wrote the music for former industrial Bris-band PURE BUNK, for post-production work, and remixes for numerous national and international artists. Andy advises that at "101" HAMMERHEAD will be presenting a "soothing mix of Greek oompah and grass roots country and western"! You can also expect a stunning venture into pure electro territory.

ALIEONIX: With The Force commanding him to purchase a synthesizer at an early age, Duncan Fairbrother set about deconstructing what he heard into sounds and textures later to find a home in SPHERE; an original of the species that existed through the Nineties. In 2001 we find Duncan capitalising on his exposure to the best of British trance & electronica in the development of ALIEONIX. His appearance at "101" will incorporate a guest vocal appearance from Manta Ray of ZEPHYR TIMBRE.
